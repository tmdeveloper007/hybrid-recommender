"""
backend/csrf.py — Double Submit Cookie CSRF protection.

How it works:
  1. Client calls GET /api/csrf-token.
  2. Server generates a cryptographically secure token, writes it into a
     cookie named `csrftoken` (readable by JS — NOT HttpOnly), and also
     returns it in the JSON body so the frontend can store it in memory.
  3. On every state-mutating request (POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE) the
     client must echo the same token value back in the `X-CSRF-Token`
     request header.
  4. CSRFMiddleware reads both values and compares them with a
     constant-time comparison.  A mismatch → 403.

Why Double Submit Cookie is correct here:
  - The project has no server-side sessions, so the Synchronizer Token
    pattern (server stores token per session) is not applicable.
  - The backend does not use cookies for authentication, so an attacker
    cannot exploit cookie-based auth via CSRF.
  - A cross-origin page cannot read the `csrftoken` cookie value
    (SameSite + CORS restrictions), so it cannot forge the header.

Skipped methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS  (safe / pre-flight).
WebSocket upgrades are also skipped — they are not affected by CSRF.

def set_csrf_cookie(response: Response, token: str) -> None:
    """
    Write the CSRF token into a cookie and set cache-prevention headers.

    Cookie flags — every flag is a deliberate security decision:

      httponly=False
        The Double Submit Cookie pattern REQUIRES JavaScript to read this
        cookie value so it can copy it into the X-CSRF-Token request header.
        Setting HttpOnly=True would break the pattern entirely because JS
        cannot read HttpOnly cookies.  The security model relies on the
        Same-Origin Policy: a cross-origin attacker cannot read this cookie
        even though it is not HttpOnly.

      samesite="lax"
        Blocks the cookie from being sent on cross-site POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
        requests initiated by third-party pages (form submissions, AJAX from
        other origins).  This is the primary browser-level CSRF defence.
        "Lax" still allows the cookie on top-level GET navigations, which is
        required for OAuth redirect flows.  Use "strict" only if you are
        certain no cross-site GET navigation needs to carry the cookie.

      secure=_is_secure_context()
        When True (production), the browser only sends this cookie over HTTPS.
        This prevents the token from being transmitted in plaintext over HTTP,
        which would allow a network attacker to steal it.
        Disabled via CSRF_SECURE=false for local HTTP development only.

      path="/"
        The cookie is sent on every request to this origin, not just a
        specific path prefix.  Required because API endpoints are spread
        across /api/* and the frontend is served from /.

      max_age=CSRF_COOKIE_MAX_AGE
        8-hour expiry.  Uses max_age (seconds, relative) rather than expires
        (absolute datetime) to avoid clock-skew issues between client and
        server.  The browser deletes the cookie automatically after expiry.

    Response headers:

      Cache-Control: no-store
        Prevents any proxy, CDN, or browser cache from storing the token
        response.  A cached CSRF token response would allow an attacker to
        replay a stale token or observe a token issued to another user.

      Pragma: no-cache
        HTTP/1.0 cache-control compatibility header.  Modern proxies use
        Cache-Control, but Pragma ensures older intermediaries also do not
        cache this response.

    WHY NOT BaseHTTPMiddleware?
    BaseHTTPMiddleware buffers the entire response body before sending it.

    response_time_middleware (registered via @app.middleware("http")) tries
    to append X-Response-Time to the already-consumed response object,
    raising a MutableHeaders error on Starlette >= 0.20.  The raw ASGI
    approach avoids all buffering — the 403 is sent directly down the
    ASGI send channel without touching any outer middleware's response object.
